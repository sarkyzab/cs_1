# Hello, I am Zakari Mumuni 
For the past five years, I've thrived in the dynamic world of cybersecurity as a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.  My passion for protecting digital assets fuels my commitment to ensuring system integrity against ever-evolving threats.  I excel at analyzing security events with a keen eye for identifying potential vulnerabilities and threats.  Leveraging my expertise in SIEM, IDS, and other security technologies, I effectively detect suspicious activity and indicators of compromise (IOCs).  This allows me to swiftly assess incident severity and prioritize responses, ensuring a rapid and efficient mitigation strategy.
