## Problem Statement

The purpose of this tutorial is to use Sysmon with VirusTotal to:
* monitor endpoint events
* configure FIM to detect and scan files added or modified <br>


## Process Steps

* Time incident occurred: 1.23pm. <br>
* Explain how the IT team became aware of the incident: The customer reported to the company that they were unable to gain access to the company’s website. It was then reported that the message on the web page is “port unreachable”. <br>
* Explain the actions taken by the IT department to investigate the incident:
Security engineers had a look on the webpage and received an error “port being unreachable”. The team used TCPdump (network analyzer) to see the network traffic surrounding the website. <br>
* Note key findings of the IT department's investigation (i.e., details related to the port affected, DNS server, etc.): 
Go to website then load the webpage while monitoring the networks via TCPdump. It received lots of traffic. Sent UDP packets and received ICMP response to return to the host that indicates port 53 unreachable. <br>
* Note a likely cause of the incident:
Determine whether port 53 is working or not. IF it’s fine, then check firewall. <br>
-Firewall: The ability to block network traffic on specific ports. Port blocking can be used to stop or prevent an attack. <br>
-DOS: There could be flood of information being sent to the network device to make it crash or unable to function. The hacker could disable dns server using DOS attack. Or someone within the organization might have disabled port 53 on firewalls. <br>
